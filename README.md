# pacmen

## Project Description
This simple "Pacman" game was an assignment for the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. This project uses Javascript to produce Pacman-like images that will move across the viewer's screen.

## How to Run
You can run this code locally by downloading all of the files here to a single directory, using the same file structure. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to load the game.

## Roadmap: Planned Improvements
- [x] Update Pacman's movement so that his mouth opens and closes as he moves
- [ ] Make Pacman face in the direction that he is moving
- [ ] Move buttons outside of the game div to avoid issue where Pacmen are initialized on top of buttons (which blocks the user from clicking them)
- [ ] Implement "Add Ghost" button to add ghosts to the game
- [ ] Make Pacmen and ghosts decrease in size when the bounce off the walls
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Add a fun background to the game board
- [ ] Add "Stop game" button to stop the setTimeout function
